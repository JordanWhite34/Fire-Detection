# Fire Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between images containing fire and those that don't. The dataset used was created during the NASA Space Apps Challenge in 2018 and consists of 755 outdoor-fire images and 244 non-fire nature images.
